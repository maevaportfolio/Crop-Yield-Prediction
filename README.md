Agriculture plays a pivotal role in the global economy. With the continuous expansion of the human population, understanding global agricultural yields is crucial to addressing food security challenges and mitigating the impacts of climate change.

Predicting crop yields is a significant agricultural issue. Agricultural yield primarily depends on weather conditions (rainfall, temperature, etc.), pesticides, and accurate historical crop yield information is a vital element in making decisions related to agricultural risk management and future forecasts.

Here is the final result of my project realized with Flask. The outcome allows us to conclude on the potential yield per hectare in the indicated country.

**Reading: In Albania, a production of 36,613 yields per hectare is recorded for corn.**
